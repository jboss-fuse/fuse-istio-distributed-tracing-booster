= Istio distributed tracing - Fuse Booster

== Overview

The Fuse Istio distributed tracing booster demonstrate Istio’s Distributed Tracing via a (minimally) instrumented set of Apache Camel/Spring Boot applications:

* A _name service_ that returns a name to greet.
* A _greeting service_ that invokes the name service to get a name and then returns the `Hello, NAME` string.

By injecting Istio envoy proxy sidecars containers both applications will be part of a so called service mesh and a number of tracing informations can be automatically gathered by Istio following the flow of the request across the services.

== Deployment options

You can run this booster in the following modes:

* Single-node OpenShift cluster
* OpenShift Online at link:{launchURL}[]

The most effective way to run this booster is to deploy and run the project on OpenShift.

For more details about running this booster on a single-node OpenShift cluster, CI/CD deployments, as well as the rest of the runtime, see the link:http://appdev.openshift.io/docs/spring-boot-runtime.html[Spring Boot Runtime Guide].

IMPORTANT: This booster requires Java 8 JDK or later and Maven 3.3.x or later.

== Prerequisites
* Openshift 3.10 (or newer) / Kubernetes 1.10 (or newer) cluster
* Istio 1.0.x installed on the aforementioned cluster
** if istio is not installed and you have admin privileges, you can isntall it using the link:https://github.com/Maistra/istio-operator[Istio Operator]. Follow link:https://github.com/Maistra/openshift-ansible/blob/maistra-0.1.0-ocp-3.1.0-istio-1.0.0/istio/Installation.md[these] instructions for more information about the Operator
** Login to the cluster with the *admin* user

== Running the booster on a single-node OpenShift cluster
A single-node OpenShift cluster provides you with access to a cloud environment that is similar to a production environment.

If you have a single-node OpenShift cluster, such as Minishift or the Red Hat Container Development Kit, link:http://appdev.openshift.io/docs/minishift-installation.html[installed and running], you can deploy your booster there.

To deploy this booster to a running single-node OpenShift cluster:

. Download the project and extract the archive on your local filesystem.

. Log in to your OpenShift cluster:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc login -u system:admin
----

. Create a new OpenShift project for the booster:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc new-project MY_PROJECT_NAME
----

. Change the directory to the folder that contains the extracted booster application (for example, `my_openshift/{repoName}`) :
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ cd my_openshift/fuse-springboot-circuit-breaker-booster
----

. Build and deploy the project to the OpenShift cluster:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ mvn clean -DskipTests fabric8:deploy -Popenshift
----

. If your environment dose not support automatic sidecar injection, you need to manually inject istio sidecar envoy proxy:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc get dc name-service -o yaml | /home/valdar/Downloads/istio-1.0.2/bin/istioctl kube-inject -f - | oc apply -f -
----

. Create a RouteRule to forward traffic from istio-ingress to the demo application:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc create -f istio/greetings-gateway.yml
----

. Access the application trough istio-ingress:
+
Run the following command to determine the appropriate URL to access our demo. Make sure you access the url with the HTTP scheme. HTTPS is NOT enabled by default:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ echo http://$(oc get route istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}{"\n"}' -n istio-system)/greeting/
----
+
The result of the above command is the istio-system istio-ingress URL, appended with the RouteRule path. Open this URL in your a web browser.

. Access the Jaeger tracing dashboard
+
The traces from the invocation of the two endpoints should look like the following:
+
image::doc/trace.png[]
+
Note that it could take a few seconds for all the spans to be collected and presented in a trace that matches the picture above

== Running the booster on OpenShift Online

To deploy the circuit breaker booster directly to OpenShift Online when you create the project at link:{launchURL}[]:

. Go to link:{launchURL}[].
. At the *Deployment step*, select *Use OpenShift Online*.
. Follow the on-screen instructions to create a new *Circuit Breaker* project using the *Fuse* runtime.

NOTE: As part of the process of creating this booster, link:{launchURL}[] sets up a project with a CI/CD deployment of this booster. You can see the status of this deployment in your single-node OpenShift cluster or OpenShift Online web console.
