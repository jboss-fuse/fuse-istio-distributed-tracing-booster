= Istio distributed tracing - Fuse Booster

== Overview

The Fuse Istio distributed tracing booster demonstrates Istio’s Distributed Tracing via a (minimally) instrumented set of Apache Camel/Spring Boot applications:

* A _name service_ that returns a name to greet.
* A _greeting service_ that invokes the name service to get a name and then returns the `Hello, NAME` string.

When you run this booster, it injects Istio envoy proxy sidecars containers and both applications become part of a "service mesh". Istio automatically gathers tracing information by following the flow of a request across the services.

== Deployment options

You can run this booster in the following modes:

* Single-node OpenShift cluster
* OpenShift Online at link:{launchURL}[]


=== Prerequisites

* Java 8 JDK (or later)
* Maven 3.3.x (or later)
* OpenShift 3.10 (or later) / Kubernetes 1.10 (or later) cluster
* Istio 1.0.x installed on the cluster
+
If Istio is not installed and you have admin privileges, you can install it using the link:https://github.com/Maistra/istio-operator[Istio Operator] by following  link:https://github.com/Maistra/openshift-ansible/blob/maistra-0.1.0-ocp-3.1.0-istio-1.0.0/istio/Installation.md[these instructions].

As part of the process of creating this booster, link:{launchURL}[] sets up a project with a CI/CD deployment of this booster. You can see the status of this deployment in your single-node OpenShift cluster or OpenShift Online web console.

== Running the booster on a single-node OpenShift cluster
A single-node OpenShift cluster provides you with access to a cloud environment that is similar to a production environment.

If you have a single-node OpenShift cluster, such as Minishift or the Red Hat Container Development Kit, link:http://appdev.openshift.io/docs/minishift-installation.html[installed and running], you can deploy your booster there.

For more details about running this booster on a single-node OpenShift cluster, CI/CD deployments, as well as the rest of the runtime, see the link:http://appdev.openshift.io/docs/spring-boot-runtime.html[Spring Boot Runtime Guide].

To deploy this booster to a running single-node OpenShift cluster:

. Download the booster project and extract the archive on your local file system.

. Log in to your OpenShift cluster:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc login -u system:admin
----

. Create a new OpenShift project for the booster:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc new-project MY_PROJECT_NAME
----

. Change the directory to the folder that contains the extracted booster application (for example, `my_openshift/{repoName}`) :
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ cd my_openshift/fuse-istio-distributed-tracing-booster
----

. Build and deploy the project to the OpenShift cluster:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ mvn clean -DskipTests fabric8:deploy -Popenshift
----

. If your environment does not support automatic sidecar injection, you must manually inject the Istio sidecar envoy proxy:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc get dc name-service -o yaml | /home/username/Downloads/istio-1.0.2/bin/istioctl kube-inject -f - | oc apply -f -
----

. Create a RouteRule to forward traffic from `istio-ingress` to the booster application:
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ oc create -f istio/greetings-gateway.yml
----

. Access the application through `istio-ingress`:

.. Run the following command to retrieve the appropriate URL to access the booster application: 
+
*Note:* Make sure you that you specify the URL with the HTTP scheme. HTTPS is *not* enabled by default.)
+
[source,bash,options="nowrap",subs="attributes+"]
----
$ echo http://$(oc get route istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}{"\n"}' -n istio-system)/greeting/
----
+
The command returns the istio-system istio-ingress URL, appended with the RouteRule path. 

.. Open the returned URL in a web browser.

.. Access the Jaeger tracing dashboard.
+
After a few seconds, when all the spans have been collected and presented in a trace, the traces from the invocation of the two endpoints should look similar to the following:
